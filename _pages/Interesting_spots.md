PTASI RAJ NATURE RESERVE
Created in 1959, Ptasi Raj (lit. Birds’ Paradise) is one of the most important bird spots in Gdańsk - over 200 species were observed here, including white-tailed eagle, western marsh harrier, various migratory ducks, geese, waders, gulls, terns, as well as many songbirds, including those inhabiting omnipresent reed beds, like bearded reedling or common reed bunting. One of the species breeding here is the common ringed plover, which is considered endangered in Poland. While the beach and the dunes in the reserve are closed to the public year-round, you can watch birds from 2 watchtowers, located near lakes Karaś and Ptasi Raj, respectively.
Location: Gdańsk, western part of Sobieszewo Island, about 10 km from Gdańsk Główny station and 14 km from the Faculty of Biology
How to get there: to Górki Wschodnie stop via bus line 186, which departs from Gdańsk Główny (approx. 40 minutes). The reserve’s border is very close to the bus stop – just around 200 metres.

## MEWIA ŁACHA NATURE RESERVE
Located in the estuary of Vistula, the longest river in Poland, Mewia Łacha (lit. Seagull Shore) combines marine, freshwater and land habitats, therefore its biodiversity is high. It is home to the only seal colony in the country - over 1000 of those marine mammals can be spotted here. The area is also important for migratory birds, like mew gulls, little gulls, terns, various waders (e.g. dunlins, ruffs and grey plovers) and ducks. Breeding species include rarities such as common ringed plover and common shelduck. You can observe the birds and seals from a safe distance thanks to the dedicated watchtower.
