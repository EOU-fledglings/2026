# Abstract Submission is now open! 🎉

We warmly invite all early-career ornithologists to submit an abstract.

Abstract submissions are accepted until **16 January 2026**.  
While full registration will open later, we can already confirm that the **conference fee will not exceed 65 EUR**.

👉 **Submit your abstract [**here**]([https://www.intercity.pl/en/](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeORiPoqpkxaBDp9-UGRXXvsslcp4YUkRuKEGf37shmkkeR8Q/viewform):**  

Please use this form to submit your abstract for either an **oral** or **poster** presentation.

**Note:** Abstract submission opens **before** participant registration.  
These are **two separate processes**.

## Pre-registration (optional, but helpful!)

If you’d like to **receive reminders by email** (registration opening, abstract deadlines, practical information, travel updates), please fill in our short form:

We also ask a few simple organisational questions.  
Your early input helps the organising committee prepare the budget, venue, and catering (including vegetarian and vegan options).
