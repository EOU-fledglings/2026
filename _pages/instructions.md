# Presentation & Poster Instructions 🎤🖼️

Thank you for contributing to the **EOU Fledglings Meeting**!  
Below you will find practical guidelines for **poster** and **oral presentations** to help everything run smoothly and on time.

---

## 🖼️ Poster Presentations

Please prepare your poster according to the following specifications:

- **Orientation:** Portrait  
- **Size:** **A0** (841 × 1189 mm)

Posters not meeting these requirements may be difficult to display, so we kindly ask you to follow the format carefully.

Poster boards and fixing materials will be provided on site.  
Details on poster session timing will be announced in the programme.

## 🎤 Oral Presentations

Please note the following guidelines for oral presentations:

- **Presentation length:**  
  - **10 minutes** 
- **Discussion:**  
  - **4 minutes** for questions and discussion

Due to the high number of presentations, we will **strictly adhere to the schedule**.  
We therefore strongly recommend rehearsing your talk in advance to ensure it fits within the allocated time.

### Slides (recommended format)

If you use slides, we suggest:

- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9  
- **File format:** `.pdf` or `.pptx`  

This will help avoid technical issues and ensure smooth transitions between speakers.
