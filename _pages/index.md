# 5th EOU Fledglings Meeting  
### Gdańsk, 27–29 March 2026  

The meeting is aimed at early-career researchers — those who are young in their research career rather than years!  
It welcomes students (Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD) as well as researchers who have completed their PhD within the last five years.

The main goals are to provide a forum for discussing ongoing research and to help early-career ornithologists build their professional networks in a relaxed and informal setting.  
While the programme (apart from plenary talks) is dedicated to early-career researchers presenting and discussing their work, anyone interested in ornithology is warmly invited to attend.
