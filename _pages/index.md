The meeting is aimed at **early-career researchers** — those who are young in their research career rather than years!  
It welcomes **students (Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD)** as well as **researchers who have completed their PhD within the last five years**.

The main goals are to **provide a forum for discussing ongoing research** and to **help early-career ornithologists build their professional networks** in a relaxed and informal setting.  
While the programme (apart from plenary talks) is dedicated to early-career researchers presenting and discussing their work, **anyone interested in ornithology is warmly invited to attend**.
